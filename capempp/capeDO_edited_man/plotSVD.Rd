\title{ 
	Plot the results of the singular value decomposition of the phenotype matrix
}
\description{
This function plots the results of the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the phenotype matrix. This plot is useful for selecting eigentraits for further analysis.
}
\usage{
plotSVD(data.obj, orientation = c("vertical", "horizontal"))
}
%- maybe also usage for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data.obj}{
	The object in which all results are stored. See \code{\link{capeDO}}.
}
  \item{orientation}{
	A character string ("vertical", or "horizontal") indicating whether the plot should be vertically or horizontally oriented.
}
}
